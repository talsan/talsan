### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My Name is Tal Sansani.

I'm is a data-scientist, quantitative researcher, and investment management consultant with over 15 years of professional experience. Prior to consulting, I built and led the data-science efforts at American Century Investments' Quantitative Equity Group, directly informing investment strategies of nearly $15B in AUM.

Apologies that most of my public projects are in working-but-not-production-ready states. Hopefully you find little useful bits to copy/paste/help guide your own developer's journey.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my little corner of the web.
