### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tal Sansani.

I'm a data-scientist, quantitative researcher, and investment management consultant with over 15 years of professional experience. Prior to consulting, I built and led the data-science efforts at American Century Investments' Quantitative Equity Group, directly informing investment strategies of nearly $15B in AUM.

Apologies ahead of time that most of my public repositories are in working-but-not-production-ready states. Hopefully you find useful little bits to support and guide your own developer's journey.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my little corner of the web. If you want to work together, discuss ideas, or just introduce yourself, I would love to hear from you.
